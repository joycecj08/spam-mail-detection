# spam-mail-detection
Hello Guys!👋
This is a spam mail detection system using machine learning algorithm with GUI(TKINTER).     
Ofcourse implemented in Python🐍.
I have used Five Classifiers to check the accuracy between the models. And turns out, SVM has the highest accuracy. Hence I have used svm as my final model to predict if the e-mail content is spam or not. There is also tkinter for gui cause I wanted something extra 🐥
